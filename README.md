# crunchyroll-go

A [Go](https://golang.org) library & cli for the undocumented [crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com) api. To use it, you need a crunchyroll premium account to for full (api) access.

**If you're searching for the command line client, head over to _[crunchy-cli](https://github.com/ottdump/crunchy-cli)_. This repo only contains the golang crunchyroll library!**

> Beginning with version v3, this project is set to maintenance mode (only small fixes, no new features) in favor of rewriting it completely in Rust.
> Go bindings for the finished rust rewrite will be provided.

## 📥 Download

Download the library via `go get`

```shell
$ go get github.com/ottdump/crunchyroll-go/v3
```

## 📚 Documentation

The documentation is available on [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ottdump/crunchyroll-go/v3).

## ☂️ Coverage

> As of _19.10.2022_ Crunchyroll rolled out a breaking change for their website which makes some of this library function unusable

Around _90% - 95%_ of the crunchyroll api (at state of writing) are implemented.
Only some endpoints on the home / index screen are missing.
Since the library will be rewritten in Rust, I don't see any further use cases of implementing the missing endpoints in this project.
They would be useless for 99% of the library usage anyway, unless you want to rebuild crunchyroll on top of it (or for whatever reason you want to implement home screen endpoints).
